Well hello there :)

Git Things Ready:
=================

We're assuming that you have Git already up and running on your computer, otherwise take a look below on how to install it:
* Windows: go to "https://git-scm.com/download" and download the installer. Go through the installation process and make sure that you install "Git Bash"
* Mac OS X: If running the command "git" from your terminal doesn't work, you can either follow the instructions you'll see in the terminal, or alternatively go to "https://git-scm.com/download" and install the Mac OS package and install it.
* Linux (Ubuntu and Ubuntu Based): If running the command "git" from your terminal doesn't work, you can either follow the instructions you'll see in the terminal (type "sudo apt-get install git" in your teminal). 

We also assume that you already have a GitHub account. If not, then go to "https://github.com" and make an account now. Take note of your username and password, you'll need it down the road for this tutorial.


Let's Git Started:
======================

Note: Going forward, all commands are expected to be run in your Git Bash (on Windows) or your Terminal windows (Mac & Linux) unless stated otherwise.



Clonning The Workshop:
----------------------

Go to the directory you want to clone the repo into and type "git clone https://github.com/m-alani/git_workshop.git"

You'll have all the files for the workshop inside the directory called "git_workshop"  


Working with your own repo:
---------------------------

Go to github.com, login with your account and create a new repo (green button saying "+ New repository". Name it "git_tutorial".
  
Now, let's make a local repo and try to upload it to our newly created repo on github.

Create a directory locally, preferably named "git_tutorial" 

Create a text file inside "git_tutorial" and name it "README.md"

In your terminal/git bash, go inside the directory you just created

Type "git init" (This will initialize an empty Git repo)

Type "git add README.md" (This will add the file to the staging area)

Type "git commit -m 'My first commit' " (Your first commit to the repo)

Type "git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/git_tutorial.git" (Add the repo you created on GitHub to the list of remotes in your local repo)

Type "git push -u origin master" (This will push any commits you have on your master branch to your origin remote)

Congrats, you've succesfully made changes locally, and pushed them to your GitHub repo (got check it out on your GitHub account)

// Follow instructions in the workshop to see how to pull changes to your local repo.


Forking someone else's repo:
----------------------------

In your browser, go to "https://github.com/m-alani/git_workshop"

Click on the "Fork" option in the top-right corner. This will make a copy of the repo you're at into your own account.

Use the commands you learned already to "clone" the repo you just forked (Don't forget, ask if you're not sure about something)

Type "git checkout -b 'testing' " (This will copy everything you have in the current branch (master) into a new branch called 'testing') and also switches you to the new branch.

Now that you have a local clone of the repo you forked from "m-alani", and you're working in a new branch, try opening the file "names.txt" in a text editor, and add your name under the line as instructed. Save the file once done.

Type "git commit -am 'added my name' " (ask us how is this different than 'git add')

Type "git branch" to see the branches in your repo, then type "git checkout master" to switch to that branch.

Open "names.txt" and confirm that your name is not there (if you don't see why it's not there, ask us) 

Type "git merge testing" (This will show you the differences between your current branch and 'testing', and merge them into your current branch 'master')

Now that we've merged the branches, we don't really need 'testing', so, let's delete it.

Type "git branch -d testing" (Ask about the difference between -d and -D switches)

Now try pushing the commited changes from your local master to your GitHub origin (You've used the command before, but if you forget, just ask)

// Ask us what a "pull request" is, and how to perform one

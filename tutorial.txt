Well hello there :)

Git Things Ready:
=================

We're assuming that you have Git already up and running on your computer, otherwise take a look below on how to install it:
* Windows: go to "https://git-scm.com/download" and download the installer. Go through the installation process and make sure that you install "Git Bash"
* Mac OS X: If running the command "git" from your terminal doesn't work, you can either follow the instructions you'll see in the terminal, or alternatively go to "https://git-scm.com/download" and install the Mac OS package and install it.
* Linux (Ubuntu and Ubuntu Based): If running the command "git" from your terminal doesn't work, you can either follow the instructions you'll see in the terminal (type "sudo apt-get install git" in your teminal). 

We also assume that you already have a GitHub account. If not, then go to "https://github.com" and make an account now. Take note of your username and password, you'll need it down the road for this tutorial.


Let's Git Started:
======================

Note: Going forward, all commands are expected to be run in your Git Bash (on Windows) or your Terminal windows (Mac & Linux) unless stated otherwise.



Clonning The Workshop:
----------------------

Go to the directory you want to clone the repo into and type "git clone https://github.com/m-alani/git_workshop.git"  
You'll have all the files for the workshop inside the directory called "git_workshop"  


Working with your own repo:
---------------------------

Go to github.com, login with your account and create a new repo (green button saying "+ New repository". Name it "git_tutorial".
  
Now, let's make a local repo and try to upload it to our newly created repo on github.

Create a directory locally, preferably named "git_tutorial" 

Create a text file inside "git_tutorial" and name it "README.md"

In your terminal/git bash, go inside the directory you just created

Type "git init" (This will initialize an empty Git repo)

Type "git add README.md" (This will add the file to the staging area)

Type "git commit -m 'My first commit' " (Your first commit to the repo)

Type "git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/git_tutorial.git" (Add the repo you created on GitHub to the list of remotes in your local repo)

Type "git push -u origin master" (This will push any commits you have on your master branch to your origin remote)

Congrats, you've succesfully made changes locally, and pushed them to your GitHub repo (got check it out on your GitHub account)


// Follow instructions in the workshop to see how to pull changes to your local repo.
